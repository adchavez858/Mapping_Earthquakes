# Mapping_Earthquakes


## Overview

The purpose of this project is to visually show the differences between the magnitudes of earthquakes all over the world for the last seven days. The GeoJSON earthquake data, the geographical coordinates, and an magnitudes of earthquakes were then pulled from the last seven days then added to a map. Since the information is linked to a real-time source, so the map updates whenever the user accesses it.
